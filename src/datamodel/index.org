* Notation
** Sets, cardinality and relations

If =A= is a set, then
    1. =A!= denotes exactly one element of =A=.
    2. =A?= denotes at most one element of =A=.
    3. =A+= denotes  one or more elements of =A=
    4. =A*=  denotes at zero or more elements of =A=.  Often
       abbreviated as =A=.

    5. =A > B= denotes a relation /from/ =A= /to/ =B=.


** Relations and their cardinality type

A relation =r:A > B= could relate each element of =A= to
zero, one or more elements of =B=.

|--------------------------------+-----------+---+---|
| Cardinality of B               | Notation  |   |   |
|--------------------------------+-----------+---+---|
| at least zero elements of =B=. | r: A > B  |   |   |
|--------------------------------+-----------+---+---|
| at most one element of =B=     | r: A > B? |   |   |
|--------------------------------+-----------+---+---|
| at least one element of =B=    | r: A > B+ |   |   |
|--------------------------------+-----------+---+---|
| exactly one element of =B=     | r: A > B! |   |   |
|--------------------------------+-----------+---+---|
   
** Example of Entity Relationship notation
    
#+begin_example
 [email, user] : User? > Email!
#+end_example

Encodes the following items of information:

 - =email= is a relation /from/ the set =User= /to/ the set
   =Email=.

 - =User= is called the /domain/ of the relation =email=.

 - =Email= is called the /codomain/ of the relation =email=.

 - The relation =email= relates each element of =User= to
   /exactly one/ element of =Email=.  This is written as 

 #+begin_example
 email: User > Email!
 #+end_example

 - =user= is a relation /from/ the set =Email= /to/ the set
   =User=.

 - =Email= is called the /domain/ of the relation =user=.

 - =User= is called the /codomain/ of the relation =user=.

 - The relation =user= relates each element of =Email= to
   /at most one/ element of =User=.  This is written as 

 #+begin_example
 user: Email > User?
 #+end_example


* Abstract Entity Types
#+BEGIN_SRC spec :tangle spec.txt
User
#+END_SRC

* Relations and cardinality constraints over entity types 
For each relation, we define its inverse next to it.
#+BEGIN_SRC spec :tangle spec.txt
[email, user]  :  User?    > Email!
#+END_SRC

** Keys

An entity =K= is called a /key for/ an entity =A= if there
is a relation =r: A? > K!=.

|---------+-------+---+---+---|
| Entity  | Key   |   |   |   |
|---------+-------+---+---+---|
| User    | Email |   |   |   |
|---------+-------+---+---+---|


* Disjoint Unions
#+BEGIN_SRC spec :tangle spec.txt
Role = user + admin
#+END_SRC

* System state
  The system's state is captured by a set of /state
  variables/.  
** Primary Entity sets

For the purpose of /the application/, we maintain two primary
state variables.  

 #+BEGIN_SRC spec
 user-set    : set[User]    ; set of users in the system
 #+END_SRC

and five relations

 #+BEGIN_SRC spec
 email:      User > Email!
 #+END_SRC

*** Applying relations to sets
#+begin_example


1.role = admin
2.role = user
5.role = user
{1,2,5}.role = {admin, user,user} = {admin, user}

{1,2,5}.succ = {2,3,6}
{1,2,6}.factors = {{1}, {1,2}, {1,2,3,6}}
{1,2,6}.factors.union = {{1}, {1,2}, {1,2,3,6}}.union = {1,2,3,6}
#+end_example

** Derived Entity sets
 #+BEGIN_SRC spec :tangle spec.txt
 email-set   : set[Email]   = user-set.email        ; set of emails in the system
 #+END_SRC

** Referential Integrity Constraints over entity-sets
These specifications also capture referential integrity.
#+BEGIN_SRC spec :tangle spec.txt
[email, user]    :  user-set!    > email-set!
#+END_SRC

* Operations 
CRUD operations.  

Each operation is performed on an entity instance or an
entity-set.   The operation may take additional parameters.
It also takes as a  parameter of the credentials of the
actor performing the operation.

 - C  create a user      
 - R  read from a user   
 - U  update a user      
 - D  delete a user      

** Actor
Operations are performed by Actors.  Our application has two
types of actors:  =system= and =session=. 

|----------------------------------------+------------------------+----------------+-------------------|
| Operation                              | Actor                  | Ref.           | Result            |
|                                        | Credentials            | Integrity      |                   |
|----------------------------------------+------------------------+----------------+-------------------|
